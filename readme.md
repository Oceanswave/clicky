# :sparkles: Clicky clicks things :sparkles:

Ever in a situation where you need to click the left mouse button rapidly? Sore index fingers *begone*!

Just download and start clicky using

```
npm install https://github.com/oceanswave/clicky
npm start
```

and press the backtick key
#### *your clicking problems are whisked away!*

You can do more than just clicks, just fork, modify clicky.js to suit your needs and *wham* you're golden.

Have fun!
